# Responsible Disclosure Policy

## Introduction

<!-- Why responsible disclosure matters in AI safety research -->

## Disclosure Principles

### Core Values

- Prioritize public safety over recognition
- Give vendors reasonable time to fix issues
- Coordinate disclosure timing
- Provide actionable information
- Follow up to ensure resolution

## Disclosure Process

### Step 1: Initial Discovery

<!-- What to do when you find a vulnerability -->

#### Documentation

<!-- How to document the finding -->

#### Verification

<!-- Confirming the vulnerability is real and reproducible -->

#### Impact Assessment

<!-- Determining severity and potential harm -->

### Step 2: Vendor Notification

<!-- How to contact the vendor -->

#### Initial Contact

<!-- First communication with the vendor -->

#### Information to Include

- Clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof of concept (if appropriate)
- Severity assessment
- Suggested mitigations
- Proposed disclosure timeline

#### Secure Communication

<!-- Using encrypted channels for sensitive information -->

### Step 3: Vendor Engagement

<!-- Working with the vendor -->

#### Acknowledgment

<!-- Confirming receipt of the report -->

#### Dialogue

<!-- Ongoing communication during investigation -->

#### Timeline Negotiation

<!-- Agreeing on disclosure timing -->

### Step 4: Remediation

<!-- Supporting the fix process -->

#### Testing Fixes

<!-- Validating proposed solutions -->

#### Feedback

<!-- Providing input on remediation approach -->

### Step 5: Public Disclosure

<!-- When and how to go public -->

#### Timing

<!-- Standard: 90 days, but flexible based on context -->

#### Content

<!-- What to include in public disclosure -->

- Description of vulnerability (appropriately detailed)
- Impact and severity
- Affected systems
- Mitigation status
- Credit and acknowledgments
- Timeline

#### Coordination

<!-- Aligning with vendor's disclosure -->

### Step 6: Follow-up

<!-- After disclosure -->

#### Community Response

<!-- Addressing questions and feedback -->

#### Lessons Learned

<!-- Improving the process for next time -->

## Special Cases

### Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities

<!-- When immediate disclosure may be needed -->

### Unresponsive Vendors

<!-- What to do when vendors don't respond -->

### Legal Threats

<!-- Handling legal pushback -->

### Zero-Day Vulnerabilities

<!-- Special considerations for unknown vulnerabilities -->

## Coordinated Disclosure

### Multi-vendor Issues

<!-- When multiple vendors are affected -->

### Industry-wide Problems

<!-- Systemic vulnerabilities -->

## Documentation Standards

### Internal Records

<!-- What to keep for your records -->

### Public Reports

<!-- What to share publicly -->

## Examples

<!-- Real-world examples of good disclosure -->

## References

<!-- Industry standards and guidelines -->
