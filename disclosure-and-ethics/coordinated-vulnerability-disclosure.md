# Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

## Introduction

<!-- Overview of CVD in the context of AI systems -->

## CVD Process

### Discovery Phase

#### Finding the Vulnerability

<!-- Initial discovery -->

#### Initial Triage

<!-- Assessing what you've found -->

- Is this a real vulnerability?
- Who is affected?
- What is the severity?
- Is it already known?

### Reporting Phase

#### Identifying Stakeholders

<!-- Who needs to know -->

- Primary vendor/developer
- Affected third parties
- Infrastructure providers
- Security teams

#### Multi-party Coordination

<!-- When multiple parties are involved -->

- Coordinating disclosure timeline
- Sharing information securely
- Aligning on remediation approach

#### Reporting Channels

<!-- How to contact stakeholders -->

- Security email addresses
- Bug bounty programs
- Coordinated disclosure platforms
- Direct relationships

### Investigation Phase

#### Vendor Analysis

<!-- Vendor investigates the report -->

#### Researcher Support

<!-- Helping vendors understand the issue -->

- Providing additional details
- Reproducing the vulnerability
- Answering technical questions

#### Status Updates

<!-- Keeping all parties informed -->

### Remediation Phase

#### Fix Development

<!-- Vendor develops a fix -->

#### Testing and Validation

<!-- Verifying the fix works -->

- Independent verification
- Regression testing
- Coverage assessment

#### Deployment Planning

<!-- Coordinating the rollout -->

### Disclosure Phase

#### Timing

<!-- When to disclose -->

- Default: 90 days from initial report
- Extensions for complex fixes
- Accelerated for active exploitation
- Vendor coordination

#### Disclosure Content

<!-- What to publish -->

- Technical advisory
- Affected versions
- Remediation steps
- Credit and acknowledgments
- Timeline

#### Coordinated Release

<!-- Aligning announcements -->

- Vendor advisory
- Researcher disclosure
- CVE assignment (if applicable)
- Public communication

### Post-Disclosure Phase

#### Community Response

<!-- After going public -->

- Answering questions
- Clarifying details
- Additional guidance

#### Lessons Learned

<!-- Improving the process -->

## Multi-vendor Scenarios

### Industry-wide Vulnerabilities

<!-- When many vendors are affected -->

#### Coordination Challenges

<!-- Managing complexity -->

#### Information Sharing

<!-- Secure disclosure to multiple parties -->

### Supply Chain Issues

<!-- Vulnerabilities in dependencies -->

## CVD for AI Systems

### Unique Challenges

#### Model Updates

<!-- Fixes may require retraining -->

#### Behavioral Vulnerabilities

<!-- Not always a code fix -->

#### Emergent Issues

<!-- Problems that arise from scale or interaction -->

### AI-Specific Considerations

- Prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Model jailbreaks
- Training data poisoning
- Bias and fairness issues
- Privacy leakage

## Communication Best Practices

### Clear Communication

<!-- Writing effective vulnerability reports -->

### Maintaining Confidentiality

<!-- Protecting sensitive information -->

### Managing Expectations

<!-- Setting realistic timelines -->

## Handling Difficulties

### Unresponsive Vendors

<!-- When vendors don't engage -->

#### Escalation Steps

1. Try alternative contact methods
2. Give reasonable additional time
3. Consider public disclosure with redacted details
4. Document all attempts at contact

### Vendor Disputes

<!-- Disagreements about severity or fixes -->

### Legal Threats

<!-- Vendor legal pushback -->

## Tools and Platforms

### Disclosure Platforms

<!-- Services that facilitate CVD -->

- HackerOne
- Bugcrowd
- Security.txt
- Vendor-specific programs

### Secure Communication

<!-- Tools for safe information sharing -->

- PGP/GPG encryption
- Secure file sharing
- Private repositories

## CVE Process

### When to Request a CVE

<!-- CVE assignment criteria -->

### CVE Assignment Process

<!-- How to get a CVE ID -->

## Documentation

### Timeline Tracking

<!-- Recording key dates and actions -->

### Communication Log

<!-- Keeping records of all interactions -->

### Evidence Preservation

<!-- Maintaining proof of disclosure -->

## Case Studies

<!-- Examples of successful and problematic CVD -->

## References

<!-- ISO 29147, CERT/CC guidelines, etc. -->
