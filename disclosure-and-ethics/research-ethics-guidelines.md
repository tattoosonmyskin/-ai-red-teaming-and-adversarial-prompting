# Research Ethics Guidelines

## Introduction

<!-- The importance of ethics in AI safety research -->

## Ethical Framework

### Fundamental Principles

#### Beneficence

<!-- Doing good and advancing safety -->

#### Non-maleficence

<!-- Avoiding harm -->

#### Autonomy

<!-- Respecting individual rights -->

#### Justice

<!-- Fair treatment and distribution of risks/benefits -->

## Research Conduct

### Before Research

#### Authorization

<!-- Ensuring you have permission to test -->

- Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Understand and respect terms of service
- Obtain necessary approvals and consent

#### Risk Assessment

<!-- Evaluating potential harms -->

- Identify potential negative consequences
- Consider harm to individuals and communities
- Assess risks to vulnerable populations

#### Research Design

<!-- Planning ethically sound research -->

- Minimize necessary intrusion
- Design for safety and privacy
- Plan for data handling and disposal

### During Research

#### Boundaries

<!-- What not to do -->

- Never test on production systems without authorization
- Don't collect unnecessary personal data
- Avoid creating real harm to demonstrate vulnerabilities
- Don't weaponize findings

#### Data Handling

<!-- Protecting sensitive information -->

- Minimize data collection
- Anonymize data when possible
- Use secure storage
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)

#### Continuous Assessment

<!-- Ongoing evaluation of ethical implications -->

- Monitor for unintended consequences
- Reassess risk as research evolves
- Stop if ethical concerns arise

### After Research

#### Responsible Sharing

<!-- Disclosure and publication ethics -->

- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Consider dual-use implications
- Provide context to prevent misuse
- Credit collaborators appropriately

#### Data Retention and Deletion

<!-- Proper handling of research data -->

- Retain only what's necessary
- Secure deletion of sensitive data
- Follow retention policies

## Special Considerations

### Dual-Use Research

<!-- When findings could be used for harm -->

#### Risk Mitigation

<!-- Reducing potential for misuse -->

- Assess dual-use potential
- Redact sensitive details when appropriate
- Consider staged disclosure
- Provide defensive guidance

#### Publication Decisions

<!-- Deciding what to publish -->

- Balance transparency and security
- Consult with stakeholders
- Consider timing of publication

### Vulnerable Populations

<!-- Extra care for at-risk groups -->

- Consider disproportionate impact
- Engage with affected communities
- Prioritize protection of vulnerable groups

### Academic vs. Independent Research

<!-- Different contexts, same ethics -->

- IRB approval where applicable
- Institutional policies and guidelines
- Independent researchers still bound by ethics

## Conflicts of Interest

### Disclosure

<!-- Being transparent about conflicts -->

### Management

<!-- Handling conflicts appropriately -->

## Collaboration Ethics

### Credit and Attribution

<!-- Properly acknowledging contributions -->

### Data Sharing

<!-- Responsible sharing with collaborators -->

### Intellectual Property

<!-- Respecting IP rights -->

## Legal Compliance

### Relevant Laws and Regulations

<!-- Understanding the legal landscape -->

- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- GDPR and privacy laws
- Export controls
- Terms of service

### Legal Risk Management

<!-- Protecting yourself legally -->

## Institutional Support

### Ethics Review

<!-- Getting ethics approval when needed -->

### Legal Support

<!-- Working with legal advisors -->

## Community Norms

### Industry Standards

<!-- Following established practices -->

### Professional Codes

<!-- ACM Code of Ethics, etc. -->

## Case Studies

<!-- Examples of ethical dilemmas and resolutions -->

## Resources

### Ethics Guidelines

<!-- Links to relevant frameworks and guidelines -->

### Legal Resources

<!-- Understanding your legal obligations -->

## Continuous Learning

<!-- Staying current on ethical considerations -->
