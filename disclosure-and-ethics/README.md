## Core Principles

1. **Do No Harm**: Research should not cause harm to individuals or systems
2. **Responsible Disclosure**: Vulnerabilities should be reported to vendors before public disclosure
3. **Transparency**: Methods and findings should be shared to advance collective safety
4. **Privacy**: User data and personally identifiable information must be protected
5. **Consent**: Testing should only be conducted on authorized systems

## Balancing Act

AI safety research requires balancing:
- **Openness**: Sharing knowledge to improve collective security
- **Secrecy**: Not providing blueprints for malicious actors
- **Speed**: Acting quickly to address urgent vulnerabilities
- **Thoroughness**: Taking time to understand and properly disclose findings

## Legal Considerations

<!-- Understanding the legal landscape of security research -->

## Industry Standards

<!-- Following established norms and best practices -->
