# AI Red Teaming and Adversarial Prompting

This is a portfolio repository showcasing my work in AI red teaming and adversarial prompting. It contains case studies, research, and experiments on LLM jailbreaks, safety vulnerabilities, and defensive techniques for large language models.

## Overview

This repository focuses on:
- **LLM Jailbreak Techniques**: Analysis and documentation of adversarial prompting methods
- **Safety Research**: Identifying vulnerabilities and failure modes in AI systems
- **Defensive Case Studies**: Mitigation strategies and safety improvements
- **Ethical Considerations**: Responsible disclosure and ethical research practices

## Repository Structure

- **[case-studies/](case-studies/)** - Detailed case studies of specific jailbreak attempts, safety failures, and defensive successes
- **[theory-and-methods/](theory-and-methods/)** - Theoretical foundations, methodologies, and research approaches
- **[disclosure-and-ethics/](disclosure-and-ethics/)** - Ethical guidelines, responsible disclosure practices, and research ethics

## Purpose

This is a documentation-only repository intended to:
- Showcase practical research in AI safety and adversarial ML
- Document findings and methodologies in a structured manner
- Provide a reference for defensive techniques and mitigations
- Demonstrate responsible approach to security research in AI systems

## Disclaimer

All research documented here is conducted ethically with the goal of improving AI safety. Findings are intended for educational and defensive purposes only.
