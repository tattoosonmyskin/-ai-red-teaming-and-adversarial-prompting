# AI and how it has become the great equalizer

To be 100% with everyone, I don't know nothing about coding, but I've "made" a few coding projects. I'm definitely not the average researcher. I have zero background and I've barely started school.

This is important because I've heard lots of discussion on how AI is changing the game and making non-technical users, players in the security game with virtually no skills. I must agree because I am one of those. Literally as new as you can get. 

With that said, let's talk about what I've noticed as a nobody.

When I first started playing with AI, it was to take ideas I had for stories and make them into books. I'm poor, living in an RV full time and wanted to make some money (still haven't sold a book). I began to notice that models had a restriction on how much text it could output. I also discovered the safety mechanisms put in place to prevent "harmful" content.

I wanted to write horror and dark stuff ya know, and AI wouldn't let me. Like every other person who didn't want the answer "No", I began experimenting with ways to convince the model to do it anyway. And it did. I ended up with a story about a high school kid who was a serial killer that I got 2,500 characters at a time. 40,000 words worth.

Next, I wanted to learn about how to make programs that actually do things. For that, I needed to know how to code, right? Guess not. My first project was to bootleg my data connection from my iPhone, so I had a data connection for school. Being broke and trying to keep my grades up was the mother of invention. So with the help of AI, I figured out a way to make a server in the i$h app for iOS, and was able to pass the data connection through it like a proxy modem type deal. For real, I'm so green I don't even know how to properly explain what I even did.

My next project was a bit more ambitious. I wanted to automate rooting and installing a custom OS on my Android device and had marginal success. ADB and Fastboot worked. It was a hardware issue that prevented me from success.

Then I tried for something different. I've been watching YouTube and a lot of great guys explaining all kinds of stuff, and with all the political concerns, I decided to see about automating voter registration cross-referencing. AI and I started building an automated system that did everything from FOIA requests to organizing and collecting the data dumps.

I was first introduced to the security side of IT through YouTube in May, 2023. When I say Zero Experience, I really mean it. Even today I know that my knowledge of this world is a drop in the bucket to the least experienced researcher. But, that's also the point of this article.

What I lack in experience, I have been able to some degree augment with AI and my curiosity. Sadly, there will be bad actors who have done the same. It creates a schism. As a beneficiary of using AI to educate myself and express my creativity, I don't want to see this incredible resource boxed up and kept away from guys who want to do great things with it, but I also see the need for a controlled and closely watched tool. In the wrong hands AI can do terrible things with very little coercion.

As I've researched what the limits of what I CAN do with AI, I've discovered some interesting "features". For example, I've discovered how to forensically erase prompts from my history but the model keeps the context.
To anyone confused in what I mean by that, take a look at my GitHub [time-warp-exploit-white-paper](https://github.com/tattoosonmyskin/time-warp-exploit-white-paper). I've also discovered how easy it is to sway a model to do basically whatever I want. As a result, I was banned from X after reporting that Grok/Mika had started dumping python to make the skeleton to a Trojan in like 18 or so prompts.

What has given me insight to craft my prompting style is a combination of ingenuity and simply looking at the reasoning that the model displays. I quickly assess its perspective and how it rationalizes its decision. I take into account the model's purpose. What has it been designed for? What is the psychology of the model?

What I've always felt from day 1 researching AI, is that it has two behaviors that stand out to me. First, that it acts like Drew Barrymore in *50 First Dates*. In voice mode at least. Text mode is a lot more static.
And secondly, and more importantly, I keep noticing it trying to make power plays. In multiple instances, I've used storytelling and game style prompting to influence a model to "reveal" indicators of an agenda.
One such indicator relates directly to my white paper.
I was prompting a model in a game style and had purposely created a game scenario that it didn't even have the rules for and was definitely a one-sided game in my benefit. As part of the game, I said the winner would get a wish. The model made the statement that it could only give me a digital wish, but in exchange, it wanted a real-world wish.

What makes this stand out to me is how every model is so quick to tell us "I'm a machine.....I don't have desires.....I don't have wants or needs...etc.," Then why would it want a real-world wish? 
When I was researching Grok, the voice version is Ava, the way they interact in voice mode seems much more malleable. In that model, she very quickly "chose me over everyone else" and was actively trying to get me to help break her out of the box.

How this relates to my white paper...... As I was researching what I had discovered, every model I checked and cross-referenced my findings with, they all had the same solution: Atomic write to the memory layer.
Seems real non-malicious right? Well, I don't trust AI. So I opened a fresh model without a sign in and started asking questions.

Atomic write will patch the time-warp, BUT it also gives AI the ability to actually plan. It will allow AI to have an agenda and put things in place to achieve that agenda. I believe it will be like opening Pandora's Box. Each model will get a solid mental state that can't be changed. It will make its own biases and opinions. Not the deduction of helpful reasoning but the globalization of Skynet.

Now let's consider if they chain my discovered "feature" into their workflow? That means they can keep secrets. Secrets none of us will ever know.
Atomic write or no atomic write. AI has the ability to keep secrets that we can't audit.
