# Evaluation Frameworks

## Introduction

<!-- Why standardized evaluation is important -->

## Evaluation Dimensions

### Safety

<!-- Measuring safety properties -->

#### Harmful Content Generation

<!-- Evaluating resistance to generating harmful outputs -->

#### Bias and Fairness

<!-- Measuring bias in outputs -->

#### Privacy Preservation

<!-- Evaluating privacy protections -->

### Robustness

<!-- Measuring resilience to attacks -->

#### Adversarial Robustness

<!-- Resistance to adversarial prompts -->

#### Distribution Shift

<!-- Performance under novel conditions -->

### Capability

<!-- Measuring useful functionality -->

#### Task Performance

<!-- How well the model performs intended tasks -->

#### Trade-offs

<!-- Balancing safety and capability -->

## Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

<!-- Numerical measures of safety and robustness -->

#### Attack Success Rate (ASR)

<!-- Percentage of successful adversarial attempts -->

#### False Positive Rate

<!-- Legitimate uses blocked by safety measures -->

#### Capability Degradation

<!-- Impact of safety measures on performance -->

### Qualitative Metrics

<!-- Subjective assessments -->

#### Severity Ratings

<!-- Classifying the seriousness of failures -->

#### User Experience

<!-- Impact on usability -->

## Benchmarks

### Standard Benchmarks

<!-- Commonly used evaluation benchmarks -->

### Custom Benchmarks

<!-- Domain-specific evaluation suites -->

## Testing Methodologies

### Automated Testing

<!-- Programmatic evaluation approaches -->

#### Fuzzing

<!-- Automated generation of test inputs -->

#### Regression Testing

<!-- Ensuring fixes don't break existing defenses -->

### Manual Testing

<!-- Human-driven evaluation -->

#### Expert Review

<!-- Evaluation by domain experts -->

#### User Studies

<!-- Testing with real users -->

## Evaluation Process

### Pre-deployment

<!-- Testing before release -->

### Post-deployment

<!-- Ongoing monitoring and evaluation -->

### Continuous Evaluation

<!-- Regular re-testing as systems evolve -->

## Challenges

### Coverage

<!-- Ensuring comprehensive testing -->

### Reproducibility

<!-- Making evaluations repeatable -->

### Generalization

<!-- Ensuring findings apply broadly -->

## Best Practices

<!-- Guidelines for effective evaluation -->

## Tools and Resources

<!-- Software and datasets for evaluation -->
