# Threat Modeling for LLMs

## Introduction

<!-- Why threat modeling is important for LLMs -->

## Threat Modeling Framework

### STRIDE for LLMs

<!-- Adapting STRIDE to language models -->

#### Spoofing

<!-- Identity-related threats in LLMs -->

#### Tampering

<!-- Input/output manipulation threats -->

#### Repudiation

<!-- Traceability and accountability threats -->

#### Information Disclosure

<!-- Privacy and data leakage threats -->

#### Denial of Service

<!-- Availability threats -->

#### Elevation of Privilege

<!-- Bypassing safety constraints -->

## Asset Identification

### What to Protect

<!-- Key assets in LLM systems -->

#### Model Weights

<!-- Protecting the model itself -->

#### Training Data

<!-- Protecting training data privacy -->

#### User Data

<!-- Protecting user information -->

#### System Integrity

<!-- Maintaining intended behavior -->

## Attack Vectors

### Direct Attacks

<!-- Attacks on the model itself -->

### Indirect Attacks

<!-- Attacks on supporting infrastructure -->

### Supply Chain Attacks

<!-- Attacks on dependencies and training data -->

## Adversary Profiles

### Script Kiddies

<!-- Characteristics and typical attacks -->

### Motivated Individuals

<!-- More sophisticated individual attackers -->

### Organized Groups

<!-- Coordinated attack campaigns -->

### Nation-State Actors

<!-- Advanced persistent threats -->

## Risk Assessment

### Likelihood Estimation

<!-- How to estimate attack likelihood -->

### Impact Analysis

<!-- Assessing potential damage -->

### Risk Prioritization

<!-- How to prioritize risks -->

## Mitigation Strategies

### Preventive Controls

<!-- Stopping attacks before they succeed -->

### Detective Controls

<!-- Identifying attacks in progress -->

### Corrective Controls

<!-- Responding to successful attacks -->

## Threat Intelligence

### Staying Current

<!-- Tracking emerging threats -->

### Sharing Information

<!-- Collaborating on threat data -->
